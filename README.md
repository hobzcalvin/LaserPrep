Two simple extensions for use with Inkscape.
Copy or symlink the .py and .inx files to your Inkscape extensions folder,
usually `C:\Users\your-user-name\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\extensions` on a PC
or `~/.config/inkscape/extensions` on MacOS/Linux, or whatever location
is set in `Inkscape Preferences > System > User extensions`.
